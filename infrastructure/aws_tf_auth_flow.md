To authenticate with AWS from the command line for your sandbox account in an AWS Organization, enabling you to use the AWS CLI and Terraform on your local machine, you need to set up temporary security credentials. Since you mentioned that you can retrieve a temporary token for the AWS Management Console, it’s likely you’re using AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) for authentication. Below, I’ll outline the step-by-step process to authenticate via the AWS CLI, configure it for Terraform, and explain relevant AWS documentation. I’ll also provide the necessary configuration files wrapped in an `<xaiArtifact>` tag as per your requirements.

## Overview of the Authentication Flow

1. **AWS IAM Identity Center Setup**: Your AWS Organization likely uses IAM Identity Center for centralized access management. You authenticate through IAM Identity Center to obtain temporary credentials (access key ID, secret access key, and session token) for your sandbox account.
2. **AWS CLI Configuration**: Use the AWS CLI to authenticate via IAM Identity Center, retrieve temporary credentials, and store them in a profile for CLI and Terraform usage.
3. **Terraform Authentication**: Configure the Terraform AWS provider to use the CLI credentials or directly assume an IAM role for the sandbox account.
4. **Security Best Practices**: Use temporary credentials to minimize security risks, following the principle of least privilege.

The flow involves logging into IAM Identity Center via the AWS CLI, exporting temporary credentials, and configuring Terraform to use them. Below are detailed instructions.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install and Verify AWS CLI
Ensure the AWS CLI (version 2) is installed on your local machine. You can check this by running:

```bash
aws --version
```

If not installed, follow the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to install it for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### Step 2: Configure AWS CLI for IAM Identity Center
Since you’re using an AWS Organization with IAM Identity Center, you’ll authenticate using the `aws configure sso` command to set up a profile for your sandbox account.

1. **Run the SSO Configuration Command**:
   ```bash
   aws configure sso
   ```

2. **Provide SSO Details**:
   - **SSO session name**: Enter a name for the session (e.g., `my-sso-session`).
   - **SSO start URL**: Enter the IAM Identity Center portal URL (e.g., `https://my-organization.awsapps.com/start`). This is provided by your AWS Organization administrator.
   - **SSO region**: Specify the region where IAM Identity Center is configured (e.g., `us-east-1`).
   - **SSO registration scopes**: Press Enter to accept the default (`sso:account:access`).

3. **Authenticate in Browser**:
   - The CLI will open a browser window prompting you to log in to the IAM Identity Center portal.
   - Authenticate using your credentials (e.g., username, password, and MFA if enabled).
   - Authorize the CLI to access your account.

4. **Select the Sandbox Account**:
   - After authentication, the CLI lists the AWS accounts and roles you have access to.
   - Select the sandbox account and the role you’ve been assigned (e.g., `AWSAdministratorAccess` or a custom role).

5. **Set Profile Name**:
   - Provide a name for the CLI profile (e.g., `sandbox-profile`).
   - The CLI will store the configuration in `~/.aws/config` and credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`.

Example output in `~/.aws/config`:
<xaiArtifact artifact_id="4d872e57-99e6-4398-99f4-2a5ae0f4c4d8" artifact_version_id="73ca4978-49d4-482e-a407-0dff49488def" title="config" contentType="text/plain">
[profile sandbox-profile]
sso_session = my-sso-session
sso_account_id = <sandbox-account-id>
sso_role_name = AWSAdministratorAccess
region = us-east-1
output = json

[sso-session my-sso-session]
sso_start_url = https://my-organization.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
</xaiArtifact>

### Step 3: Verify AWS CLI Authentication
Test the configuration by running a command with the profile:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile sandbox-profile
```

This should return your user ID, account ID, and ARN for the sandbox account, confirming successful authentication.

### Step 4: Configure Terraform to Use AWS CLI Credentials
Terraform can use the AWS CLI profile to authenticate. Create a Terraform configuration file to reference the profile.

1. **Create a Terraform Configuration File**:
   In your Terraform project directory, create a `provider.tf` file specifying the AWS provider and the profile.

<xaiArtifact artifact_id="3f52b906-9e0d-4967-b1c6-58bb3da0ea15" artifact_version_id="32d08bea-782b-4c2a-821b-ab77d249b12d" title="provider.tf" contentType="text/plain">
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  profile = "sandbox-profile"
}
</xaiArtifact>

2. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Run the following to initialize the Terraform working directory:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Test Terraform Configuration**:
   Create a simple Terraform configuration to verify authentication, such as creating an S3 bucket in the sandbox account.

<xaiArtifact artifact_id="96c52f1c-f0e4-4b38-9081-7c75b0bc94e0" artifact_version_id="aabecc7f-654f-43e7-9c4b-ef0537d7e5e3" title="main.tf" contentType="text/plain">
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-sandbox-bucket"
  tags = {
    Name        = "SandboxBucket"
    Environment = "Sandbox"
  }
}
</xaiArtifact>

4. **Apply the Configuration**:
   Run:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

   This will use the credentials from the `sandbox-profile` to deploy resources in the sandbox account.

### Step 5: Alternative Authentication with IAM Role
If you prefer not to use CLI profiles, you can configure Terraform to assume an IAM role directly using temporary credentials. This requires the role ARN for your sandbox account.

1. **Retrieve Temporary Credentials**:
   Use the AWS CLI to get temporary credentials for the role:

   ```bash
   aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<sandbox-account-id>:role/<role-name> --role-session-name my-session --profile sandbox-profile
   ```

   This returns an access key ID, secret access key, and session token.

2. **Configure Terraform with Temporary Credentials**:
   Update `provider.tf` to use these credentials:

<xaiArtifact artifact_id="63bb3c1a-401f-4a93-9162-5734be3a9257" artifact_version_id="a6bc928f-9b19-4809-8a7f-85cde8b336f4" title="provider.tf" contentType="text/plain">
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
  access_key = "<access-key-id>"
  secret_key = "<secret-access-key>"
  token      = "<session-token>"
}
</xaiArtifact>

**Security Note**: Hardcoding credentials is not recommended. Use this method only for testing, and prefer CLI profiles or role assumption for production.

### Step 6: Security Best Practices
- **Use Temporary Credentials**: IAM Identity Center provides short-lived credentials (e.g., 4 hours), reducing security risks compared to long-term keys.[](https://dev.to/aws-builders/my-personal-aws-account-setup-iam-identity-center-temporary-credentials-and-sandbox-account-39mc)
- **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials**: Store credentials in the AWS CLI configuration files or use role assumption to avoid exposing secrets in Terraform files.[](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-aws-provider)
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure the IAM role assigned to your user has only the permissions needed for the sandbox account.[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/terraform-aws-provider-best-practices/security.html)
- **Refresh Credentials**: Temporary credentials expire. Re-run `aws sso login --profile sandbox-profile` to refresh them when needed.

## Additional Notes
- **Sandbox Account Considerations**: Sandbox accounts in AWS Organizations are typically isolated and have permissive policies for development. Ensure your usage complies with your organization’s sandbox usage policy (e.g., no customer data, limited network connectivity).[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/best-practices-creating-managing-sandbox-accounts-aws/)
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - If `terraform plan` fails with “no valid credential sources,” ensure the AWS CLI profile is correctly configured and credentials are not expired. Run `aws sso login --profile sandbox-profile` to refresh.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64124063/how-to-make-terraform-to-read-aws-credentials-file)
  - Verify the region in your Terraform provider matches the sandbox account’s operational region.
- **Next Steps**: Once authenticated, you can expand your Terraform configuration to deploy your application’s infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets, or Lambda functions) in the sandbox account.

By following these steps, you’ll be able to authenticate with your AWS sandbox account from the command line and deploy infrastructure using Terraform securely and efficiently.
