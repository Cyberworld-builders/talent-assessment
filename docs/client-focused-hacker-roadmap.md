## Technical Implementation Details

### AI Integration Strategy:
```php
// Simple AI recommendation system
class AIRecommendationService {
    public function generateDevelopmentInsights($user, $assessment_results) {
        // Call OpenAI API with assessment data
        $prompt = $this->buildPrompt($user, $assessment_results);
        $response = $this->callOpenAI($prompt);
        
        // Store editable recommendations
        return $this->storeEditableRecommendations($response);
    }
    
    public function getEditableRecommendations($user_id) {
        // Return recommendations that can be edited
        return Recommendation::where('user_id', $user_id)->get();
    }
}
```

### Report Generation Strategy:
```php
// Report generation matching their format
class ReportGenerator {
    public function generateClientReport($user, $assessment_results) {
        // Generate report in their specific format
        $report_data = $this->buildReportData($user, $assessment_results);
        $report_template = $this->getClientTemplate();
        
        return $this->renderReport($report_data, $report_template);
    }
    
    public function getClientTemplate() {
        // Return their specific report template
        return view('reports.client-format');
    }
}
```

### Industry System Implementation:
```php
// Industry-specific registration
class IndustryService {
    public function registerUserWithIndustry($user_data) {
        $user = User::create([
            'name' => $user_data['name'],
            'email' => $user_data['email'],
            'industry_id' => $user_data['industry_id'],
            // ... other fields
        ]);
        
        // Apply industry-specific benchmarks
        $this->applyIndustryBenchmarks($user);
        
        return $user;
    }
}
```

- **Industry System**: Copy from source2 with minimal changes
- **Tech Upgrades**: Fix only breaking changes

### Business Risks:
- **Client Satisfaction**: Focus on their specific requirements
- **Timeline**: 7 weeks is aggressive but achievable
- **Quality**: Ship working features, refine later

## Daily Workflow (Client-Focused)

- Check client feedback
- Work on current feature
- Test AI integration
- Deploy if ready

### Afternoon (1 PM - 6 PM):
- Continue feature development
- Test report generation
- Manual testing
- Client feedback integration

### Evening (7 PM - 10 PM):
- Bug fixes
- Quick deployments
- Planning next day

## Technology Stack (Minimal)

### Backend:
- PHP 8.2 (upgraded)
- Laravel 10 (upgraded)
- MySQL 8.0 (upgraded)
- OpenAI API integration

### Frontend:
- Blade templates
- jQuery (existing)
- Basic CSS
- Report templates

### Infrastructure:
- Simple VPS hosting
- Basic backup strategy

## Next Steps

1. **Start immediately** with Industry system
2. **Deploy incrementally** as features are ready
3. **Get client feedback** on each feature
4. **Focus on their specific reports**
5. **Integrate their branding** throughout

This client-focused roadmap prioritizes their specific needs: industry system, AI-powered recommendations, and their exact report formats. We'll build the MVP they need to prove their market, then add the LINC system later when they're ready.
