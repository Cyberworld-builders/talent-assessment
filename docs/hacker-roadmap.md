# Hacker Roadmap - MVP to Market

## Philosophy: Ship Fast, Fix Later

We're building the minimum viable product to prove market demand. No enterprise overhead, no perfect code, no compliance worries. Just ship features that users will pay for.

## Current State: Legacy Codebase

## Total Timeline: 9 weeks (2.5 months)

## Cost Estimate: $15-25k

### Development Team (Lean):
- **1 Full-stack Developer**: $8-12k (9 weeks)
- **1 Part-time Developer**: $4-6k (9 weeks)
- **Infrastructure**: $3-7k

### What We're Skipping:
- Dedicated QA (we test as we go)
- Project management overhead
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Accessibility compliance
- Mobile optimization
- Advanced features
- Complex UI/UX

## Risk Mitigation (Hacker Style)

### Technical Risks:
- **Breaking Changes**: We'll fix them as they happen
- **Performance Issues**: We'll optimize when users complain
- **Security Issues**: We'll patch when we get hacked
- **Data Loss**: We'll restore from backup

### Business Risks:
- **Market Validation**: We need to prove demand first
- **Competition**: We need to ship faster than them
- **Technical Debt**: We'll refactor after we have users

## Success Metrics (MVP Focus)

3. **Get user feedback** early and often
4. **Pivot quickly** if needed
5. **Scale only after** market validation

This hacker roadmap focuses on speed and market validation over perfection. We'll build the minimum viable product, prove the market, and then invest in engineering excellence.
