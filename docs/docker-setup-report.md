# Docker Setup Report for Talent Assessment Application

## Overview

This report documents the Docker Compose setup work performed for the talent-assessment Laravel application. The setup was designed to provide a local development environment with hot reloading capabilities.

## Initial Requirements

- Docker Compose configuration for local testing
- Include containers for all dependent services (database, cache, etc.)
- Volume mapping for hot reloading
- Use `artisan serve` command to run the application
- All tooling to run inside the container

## Files Created and Modified

### 1. `docker-compose.yml` (Created)
**Purpose**: Main Docker Compose configuration
**Services**:
- `app`: PHP 7.4 application container
- `mysql`: MySQL 8.0 database (ARM64 compatible)
- `redis`: Redis 7-alpine cache (ARM64 compatible)

**Key Features**:
- Volume mapping for hot reloading: `.:/var/www`
- Proper networking with custom bridge network
- Environment variables for database and Redis configuration
- Port mapping: 8000 (app), 3306 (mysql), 6379 (redis)

### 2. `Dockerfile.dev` (Created)
**Purpose**: Development container with all necessary tools
**Base Image**: `php:7.4-fpm`

**Installed Components**:
- PHP extensions: pdo_mysql, mbstring, exif, pcntl, bcmath, gd, zip
- System dependencies: git, curl, nodejs, npm, wget, xvfb
- Development tools: vim, nano, build-essential, python, python3
- wkhtmltopdf for PDF generation
- Composer for PHP dependency management

**Key Features**:
- User: www-data (non-root)
- Working directory: /var/www
- Exposed port: 8000
- CMD: `tail -f /dev/null` (keeps container running)

### 3. `docker-compose.override.yml` (Created)
**Purpose**: Development-specific overrides
**Features**:
- Uses `Dockerfile.dev` instead of production Dockerfile
- Volume mounts for vendor and node_modules directories
- Environment variables for local development

### 4. `.dockerignore` (Created)
**Purpose**: Optimize build context
**Excluded**:
- .git, node_modules, vendor
- storage/logs, storage/framework/cache
- Various temporary and development files

### 5. `docker-setup.sh` (Created)
**Purpose**: Automated setup script
**Functions**:
- Creates `.env` file with proper configuration
- Sets up directories and permissions
- Installs PHP dependencies via composer
- Generates application key
- Runs database migrations
- Seeds database
- Starts Laravel development server

## Issues Encountered and Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing .env.example file
**Problem**: `cp: .env.example: No such file or directory`
**Solution**: Modified `docker-setup.sh` to create `.env` file directly using `cat > .env << 'EOF'`

### Issue 2: Docker Compose command not found
**Problem**: `docker-compose: command not found`
**Solution**: Updated all scripts to use `docker compose` (newer Docker versions)

### Issue 3: ARM64 compatibility issues
**Problem**: `no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8` for Redis and MySQL images
**Solutions**:
- Changed Redis from `redis:6-alpine` to `redis:7-alpine`
- Changed MySQL from `mysql:5.7` to `mysql:8.0`

### Issue 4: Vendor directory missing during build
**Problem**: `Warning: require(/var/www/bootstrap/../vendor/autoload.php): failed to open stream`
**Root Cause**: Volume mount was overriding vendor directory installed during build
**Solution**: 
- Modified `Dockerfile.dev` to install dependencies during build
- Added `--no-scripts --no-interaction` flags to composer install
- Temporarily disabled npm install due to node-sass ARM64 compilation issues

### Issue 5: Migration table name error
**Problem**: `Table 'talent_assessment.new_reports' doesn't exist`
**Solution**: Fixed migration file `2017_02_14_202921_add_name_to_reports_table.php`
- Changed table name from `new_reports` to `reports`

### Issue 6: HTTPS redirects in local development
**Problem**: Application redirecting to HTTPS in local environment
**Investigation**: 
- Found `HttpsProtocol` middleware but it was already commented out
- Checked all configuration files for HTTPS forcing
- Issue source not fully identified (likely environment-based)

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- All containers running successfully
- PHP dependencies installed
- Database migrations completed
- Database seeded with initial data
- Laravel development server running on port 8000
- Application responding correctly (302 redirect to dashboard)

### ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **HTTPS Redirects**: Application forces HTTPS redirects even in local environment
2. **Node.js Dependencies**: Temporarily disabled due to node-sass ARM64 compilation issues
3. **Frontend Assets**: Not built due to npm/node-sass issues

### 🔧 Pending Tasks
1. Resolve HTTPS redirect issue for local development
2. Fix node-sass compilation for ARM64 architecture
3. Build frontend assets
4. Test full application functionality

## Architecture Decisions

### Container Strategy
- **Multi-container approach**: Separate containers for app, database, and cache
- **Development-focused**: Uses development Dockerfile with additional tools
- **Volume mapping**: Enables hot reloading for development

### Database Strategy
- **MySQL 8.0**: Chosen for ARM64 compatibility
- **Persistent volumes**: Data persists between container restarts
- **Environment variables**: Database configuration via environment

### Caching Strategy
- **Redis 7-alpine**: Lightweight cache solution
- **Persistent volumes**: Cache data persists between restarts

## Commands Used

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Build and start containers
docker compose up -d --build

# Install dependencies
docker compose exec app composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-scripts --no-interaction

# Generate application key
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate

# Seed database
docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder

# Start development server
docker compose exec -d app php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

### Maintenance Commands
```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs

# Restart containers
docker compose restart

# Stop containers
docker compose down

# Rebuild containers
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Environment Configuration

### Database Configuration
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=talent_assessment
DB_USERNAME=talent_user
DB_PASSWORD=talent_password
```

### Redis Configuration
```env
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

### Application Configuration
```env
APP_NAME=TalentAssessment
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

### 1. Image Compatibility
- Use x86_64 images for production servers
- Consider using `mysql:5.7` for production if compatibility is needed
- Use `redis:6-alpine` for production if stability is preferred

### 2. Security Considerations
- Remove development tools from production Dockerfile
- Use non-root user in production
- Implement proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Secure database connections

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Use multi-stage builds for production
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize PHP configuration for production
- Use production-ready web server (nginx/apache)

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement proper logging configuration
- Add health checks for containers
- Set up monitoring for database and cache
- Configure backup strategies

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve HTTPS Issue**: Investigate and fix HTTPS redirects for local development
2. **Fix Node.js Dependencies**: Resolve node-sass compilation issues
3. **Build Frontend Assets**: Complete frontend asset compilation
4. **Test Full Functionality**: Verify all application features work correctly
5. **Documentation**: Create user guide for development setup
6. **Production Preparation**: Create production-ready Docker configuration

## Conclusion

The Docker setup provides a solid foundation for local development of the talent-assessment application. While some issues remain (particularly around HTTPS redirects and ARM64 compatibility), the core application is running successfully. The setup includes all necessary services and provides hot reloading capabilities for efficient development.

The main challenges encountered were related to ARM64 architecture compatibility and dependency management. These issues have been resolved through image updates and build process modifications. The remaining HTTPS redirect issue will need to be addressed for optimal local development experience.
