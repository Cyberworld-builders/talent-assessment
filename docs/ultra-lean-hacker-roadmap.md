# Ultra-Lean Hacker Roadmap
## Ship Fast, Die Hard

### Client Wants:
1. **Industry system** (registration + benchmarks)
2. **Enhanced user experience** (email verification, timezone)
3. **Advanced assessments** (specialized scoring)
4. **AI development insights** (editable recommendations)
5. **Their specific reports** (exact format + branding)
6. **Skip LINC** (build later)

### What We're NOT Building:
- LINC system (client said wait)
- Complex UI/UX
- Enterprise features
- Advanced analytics
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Accessibility compliance

## 5-Week Sprint to Market

### Week 1: Industry System (4 days)
**Goal: Industry registration + basic benchmarks**

**Hack it:**
```php
// Add to users table
Schema::table('users', function($table) {
    $table->integer('industry_id')->nullable();
});

// Copy Industry model from source2
class Industry extends Model {
    protected $fillable = ['name'];
}

// Update registration form
<select name="industry_id">
    <option value="1">Technology</option>
    <option value="2">Healthcare</option>
    // ... basic industries
</select>

// Basic benchmark calculation
public function getBenchmarkScore($user) {
    return Benchmark::where('industry_id', $user->industry_id)
                   ->where('dimension', $dimension)
                   ->avg('score');
}
```

**Ship by Friday:**
- Industry dropdown on registration
- Basic benchmark calculations
- Industry-specific scoring

### Week 2: Enhanced UX (4 days)
**Goal: Email verification + timezone support**

**Hack it:**
```php
// Add to users table
Schema::table('users', function($table) {
    $table->string('email_verified_at')->nullable();
    $table->string('timezone')->default('UTC');
});

// Simple email verification
public function verifyEmail($token) {
    $user = User::where('email_verification_token', $token)->first();
    $user->email_verified_at = now();
    $user->save();
    return redirect('/dashboard');
}

// Timezone support
public function getUserTimezone() {
    return Auth::user()->timezone ?? 'UTC';
}
```

**Ship by Friday:**
- Email verification system
- Timezone management
- Registration code validation

### Week 3: Advanced Assessments (4 days)
**Goal: Specialized scoring + 360 feedback**

**Hack it:**
```php
// Copy enhanced assessment features from source2
// Update Assessment model
class Assessment extends Model {
    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'description', 'specialized_scoring', 
        '360_enabled', 'dimensions'
    ];
}

// Specialized scoring algorithm
public function calculateSpecializedScore($user, $assessment) {
    $scores = $this->getDimensionScores($user, $assessment);
    $weights = $this->getIndustryWeights($user->industry_id);
    
    return array_sum(array_map(function($score, $weight) {
        return $score * $weight;
    }, $scores, $weights));
}

// Basic 360 feedback
public function create360Assessment($target_user, $raters) {
    foreach($raters as $rater) {
        Assignment::create([
            'user_id' => $rater->id,
            'target_user_id' => $target_user->id,
            'assessment_id' => $assessment_id,
            'type' => '360_feedback'
        ]);
    }
}
```

**Ship by Friday:**
- Specialized scoring algorithms
- Basic 360-degree feedback
- Assessment templates

### Week 4: AI Development Insights (4 days)
**Goal: AI recommendations + editable system**

**Hack it:**
```php
// OpenAI integration
class AIRecommendationService {
    public function generateInsights($user, $assessment_results) {
        $prompt = $this->buildPrompt($user, $assessment_results);
        $response = $this->callOpenAI($prompt);
        
        return Recommendation::create([
            'user_id' => $user->id,
            'content' => $response,
            'editable' => true
        ]);
    }
    
    private function buildPrompt($user, $results) {
        return "Based on this assessment data: " . json_encode($results) . 
               " Provide 3 actionable development recommendations for " . $user->name;
    }
}

// Editable recommendations
public function updateRecommendation($id, $content) {
    $rec = Recommendation::find($id);
    $rec->content = $content;
    $rec->save();
}
```

**Ship by Friday:**
- OpenAI API integration
- Development insight generation
- Editable recommendation system

### Week 5: Their Specific Reports (4 days)
**Goal: Exact report format + their branding**

**Hack it:**
```php
// Report generation system
class ClientReportGenerator {
    public function generateReport($user, $assessment_results) {
        $data = $this->buildReportData($user, $assessment_results);
        return view('reports.client-format', compact('data'));
    }
    
    private function buildReportData($user, $results) {
        return [
            'user_name' => $user->name,
            'industry' => $user->industry->name,

3. Advanced assessments
4. AI recommendations
5. Their reports

### Skip Forever:
1. LINC system
2. Complex UI/UX
3. Enterprise features
4. Advanced analytics
5. Performance optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Start today** with Industry system

3. **Get client feedback** on each feature
4. **Focus on their specific reports**
5. **Ship in 5 weeks**

This ultra-lean approach gets the client exactly what they want in 5 weeks with minimal investment. We focus only on their core requirements and ship fast.
